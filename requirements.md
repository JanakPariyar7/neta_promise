# Problem statement
The nepali politician promises a lot of things during the election time but they are not accountable once they win. The dedicated systemm where the track(public vote done/yet to done) kind of information is required. people can visit the website and they will be aware what they have promised. 

# My solution
Create a website with no signin signup, user can browse the website like it is social media feed.filter the posts based on politicians, location, trending, new, optimistic and pessimistic as well as they can share it on social media. User can view individual politicians profile and see there upvote downvote and the promies they have made. The posts will be crowdsource via a form.

# The system
The sytem should have /admin/login page to manage all the things from the admin panel. botproof a user have limited vote of 30 in a single day, a user can not vote more than once in a single post.

# UI recommended
Mobile first design with easy to use interface like social media feed. upvote, downvote and share options in each post. Just like facebook but add the filters tab in top.

# admin Flow
Admin can post the posts assign political party, politican to a post. Politician party, politician, politican brief intro these are crudable. for the post it is mostly video content and in 9:16 format. allow me to add the video and save it in uploads folder.

# User Flow
User visits website, sees posts can upvote downvote and share. no login required. can filter the posts, view the politician and political party profile. can fill up a form and share the promises vide link with admin.

# Benefits to me
I can add ads in between the posts. the ad will be basic. an image a tittle and contact me button with link.it will be shown after some posts. it is also crudable from admin panel. the admin panel can be desktop firs.

# i am using mysql for the backend and node, html and css for the frontend.
